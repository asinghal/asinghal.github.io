On Friday last week, I launched Factile at [http://www.factile.net](http://www.factile.net). It is a free and open source survey platform that I created and aims at making the job of data collection and analysis simpler.

It supports a** variety of question types** (Text boxes, Radio buttons, Check boxes, Combo boxes (dropdowns), Text areas, Plain texts, matrix of choices/ rating scales). The surveys generated are fully **mobile device compatible**. So you can create a survey and share it with people to take on iPads/ iPhones/ BackBerry/ Samsung S2s, really, anywhere! It is truly **free** and **unlimited**. There is zero usage cost, and you can add as much content to your survey as you like. And, if you wanted to **download** **it** and install on your infrastructure, you can!

Whats more? You can define **logic** in the survey, you can **build charts** of the captured data, **customize the appearance** of the survey to match your requirements and the best is, you can **request for missing features** and I'll be happy to oblige!

Check out [http://www.factile.net](http://www.factile.net) and let me know of what you think.
