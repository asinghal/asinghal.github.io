I have recently started working on Ruby and I am trying to pick up the technique via resources available on the net. there are a lot but not many look of much use. Many are screencasts (MPEGs embedded in webpages) but i dont put on head phones at work and letting the speaker on would only seem too odd.

So I downloaded Ruby myself from its website and tried to install on my computer. I have a lenovo with 3 GB RAM  and MS Windows 7 and it looks fairly good for this purpose. Anyhow, I tried and failed :-( It just wont install! After a bit of googling I came across  [this site](http://allaboutruby.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/installing-rails-on-windows-3-years-later/). And now it looks its all sorted! Let me try doing a real app now :-)
